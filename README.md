# My First Website

This is my first web development project, created as part of the Step8Up bootcamp!

It's a simple personal website built using HTML and CSS, featuring:

- A basic portfolio section to showcase what I'm learning.
- A contact form to practice handling user input.

This project focuses on solidifying my understanding of fundamental web technologies and responsive design principles.
